In polyploid species, SNP data usually contain a new type of information, the allele dosage, which is not used by current methodologies for linkage analysis and QTL mapping. Here we extend existing methodology to use dosage data on SNPs in an autotetraploid mapping population. The SNP dosages are inferred from allele intensity ratios using normal mixture models. The steps of the linkage analysis (testing for distorted segregation, clustering SNPs, calculation of recombination fractions and LOD scores, ordering of SNPs and inference of parental phase) are extended to use the dosage information. For QTL analysis, the probability of each possible offspring genotype is inferred at a grid of locations along the chromosome from the ordered parental genotypes and phases and the offspring dosages. A normal mixture model is then used to relate trait values to the offspring genotypes and to identify the most likely locations for QTLs. These methods are applied to analyse a tetraploid potato mapping population of parents and 190 offspring, genotyped using an Infinium 8300 Potato SNP Array. Linkage maps for each of the 12 chromosomes are constructed. The allele intensity ratios are mapped as quantitative traits to check that their position and phase agrees with that of the corresponding SNP. This analysis confirms most SNP positions, and eliminates some problem SNPs to give high-density maps for each chromosome, with between 74 and 152 SNPs mapped and between 100 and 300 further SNPs allocated to approximate bins. Low numbers of double reduction products were detected. Overall 3839 of the 5378 polymorphic SNPs can be assigned putative genetic locations. This methodology can be applied to construct high-density linkage maps in any autotetraploid species, and could also be extended to higher autopolyploids.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Scottish Government Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS).

Recent linkage maps for autotetraploid species include maps for potato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bradshaw1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-McCord1">[2]</xref>, alfalfa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Sledge1">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Han1">[5]</xref>, forage grasses <italic>Dactylis glomerata</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Song1">[6]</xref> and <italic>Paspalum notatum</italic> Fl&#x000fc;gge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Stein1">[7]</xref> and rose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Gar1">[8]</xref>. These maps typically consist of hundreds of markers, combining dominant markers, such as Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), with codominant markers such as Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR). For example, the potato map used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bradshaw1">[1]</xref> has 453 mapped markers, while that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-McCord1">[2]</xref> has 242 mapped markers for one parent and 219 for the other. Dominant markers are not very informative about repulsion linkages between homologous chromosomes, while the more informative codominant markers tend to be scored in smaller quantities due to their inherently lower multiplex ratio. QTLs for many important traits have been identified using these maps, but higher-density maps would benefit these studies enormously.</p><p>New genotyping technologies, for example the Illumina Infinium platform employed here, as well as sequence based methods, such as RAD sequencing, or genotyping by sequencing (GBS) allow the generation of high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data on mapping populations and other similar populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Baird1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Elshire1">[10]</xref>. Data from genotyping platforms, including Infinium data, are generally provided as allele intensities, and intensity ratios can be analysed to infer the allele dosage. Different statistical approaches for the dosage estimation have recently been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Voorrips1">[11]</xref>, using a mixture of normal distributions, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Serang1">[12]</xref>, using a graphical Bayesian model. Current methodology, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Luo1">[13]</xref>, for estimating linkage maps in polyploid species has, however, been developed for markers scored as presence/absence and does not make use of all the information available from the SNP dosages.</p><p>In this paper we extend the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Luo1">[13]</xref> for linkage map estimation in an autotetraploid population consisting of two parents and their F<sub>1</sub> offspring to use SNP dosage information generated using Illumina Infinium technology. A mixture of normal distributions is used to infer SNP dosage from the intensity data. Our approach differs from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Voorrips1">[11]</xref> by using the expected genotype frequencies for each configuration. The steps of linkage map estimation &#x02013; segregation analysis, marker clustering, calculation of pairwise recombination fractions and LOD scores, marker ordering and identification of parental phase &#x02013; are modified to use dosage data. Finally, the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Hackett1">[14]</xref> for QTL interval mapping in autotetraploids is developed to use SNP dosage data, and SNP intensity scores are mapped as QTL as a check on the estimated linkage maps.</p><p>These methods are applied to a full-sib potato population derived from a cross between processing clone 12610ab1 and the cultivar Stirling. Previous maps of this population using AFLP and SSR data have been published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bradshaw1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Meyer1">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bryan1">[17]</xref>. The parents and 190 offspring from this cross have been genotyped using an Infinium 8300 Potato SNP Array <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Felcher1">[18]</xref>, and we have used the data obtained to estimate a high-density SNP map. The methods described here are applicable to the construction of high-density linkage maps in any autotetraploid species, and could potentially be extended to higher autopolyploids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant Material</title><p>The population studied was the progeny of a cross between the breeding clone 12601ab1 and the cultivar Stirling.

The SNPs in this array were selected from a set of biallelic, high confidence SNPs identified from transcriptome sequencing of six cultivated potato cultivars using either Sanger or Illumina transcriptome sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Felcher1">[18]</xref> and genotyping carried out using an Illumina iScan Reader utilizing the Infinium HD Assay Ultra by Gen-Probe, Manchester.</p><p>DNA samples were arranged in two 96-well plates, each in an arrangement of 12 columns by 8 rows. The parents Stirling and 12601ab1 were in rows 1 and 2 of column 1 on plate 1, followed by the offspring. The intensities of the fluorescent dyes associated with the two alleles of the SNP are expressed as Cartesian coordinates (X,Y) by the programme Genome Studio. After normalisation, Genome Studio transforms the intensities to a combined SNP intensity R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;(X+Y) and an intensity ratio theta&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;(2/&#x003c0;)*arctan(Y/X) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Staaf1">[22]</xref> i.e. to polar coordinates. The theta score gives information about the dosages of each allele for the parents and offspring and was exported from Genome Studio for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p>Three criteria were used to identify SNP theta scores as suitable for further analysis: a trimmed range greater than 0.1, no strong spatial trend and no missing values.</p><p>Range: An ideal SNP for which all possible dosages (AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, BBBB) can be observed is expected to consist of theta scores in five clusters, centred around 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 respectively. This has a range of 1.0. The lowest expected range is for a simplex SNP, for example with parents AAAA x AAAB, where parents and offspring will have scores clustered around 0.0 and 0.25, and so a range of 0.25. Inspection of the data suggested the use of a trimmed range, between the 2% and 98% quantiles, to remove the influence of a small number of outliers. SNPs were retained in the set for analysis if the trimmed range was greater than or equal to 0.1.</p><p>Spatial trend: Index plots of the theta scores against the order of the samples on the plates showed that for some SNPs there was a spatial trend and/or a difference between the plates. To address this, the theta score was modelled as a smooth function of the sample order using locally-weighted regression (loess) with four degrees of freedom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Cleveland1">[23]</xref>. The spatial trend was most apparent when the range was small, with 77% of SNPs with a trimmed range less than 0.1 showing a trend that was significant with p&#x0003c;0.0001. However excluding the SNPs with a small range as described above did not remove all the SNPs showing a spatial trend. Therefore if the smooth trend was significant with p&#x0003c;0.0001, the SNP was excluded. This threshold was chosen by inspection of the theta scores to establish how severe spatial trend needed to be to affect a visual classification.</p><p>Missing values: There were a small number of SNPs with missing theta scores and for computational ease these were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Allele dosage estimation</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Possible SNP configurations</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0063939-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the possible genotype configurations and the probabilities for each dosage at a SNP for the parents and offspring in a full-sib autotetraploid mapping population.

Our experience with analysing other types of markers in tetraploid populations is that distortion in other marker configurations can give more problems in map assembly, and so for duplex and higher dosages the threshold applied was to exclude the SNP if the significance of the chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic was less than 0.01.

Group average cluster analysis was used, and a range of thresholds were explored to investigate how the SNPs should be partitioned. Two cluster analyses were run: the first consisted of the simplex and duplex SNPs from Stirling together with double-simplex and higher dosage SNPs, and the second consisted of the simplex and duplex SNPs from 12601ab1 together with double-simplex and higher dosage SNPs.

Recombination fractions and LOD scores between adjacent markers were estimated as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Ordering the SNPs</title><p>The above analysis was used to estimate the most likely phase, the recombination fraction and the LOD score for all pairs of SNPs within each of the twelve linkage groups. This information can be used to order the SNPs and estimate the distances between them, for example using the weighted least squares procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Stam1">[29]</xref> implemented in the regression mapping method of JoinMap 4.0. As there were very large numbers of SNPs in each cluster, any SNP that was a near-duplicate of another (differing for at most two of the 190 offspring) was excluded from the ordering. Two rounds of the JoinMap algorithm were used to estimate a map of SNPs that fit well according to JoinMap's chi-square criterion. Any remaining SNPs were given a more tentative allocation adjacent to the mapped SNP with which they had the highest LOD score, provided that the estimate of the recombination fraction was less than 0.05. Other SNPs remained unplaced on the map.</p><p>The final step in the map construction was to reconstruct the phase of the complete linkage group. The simplex SNPs provide a framework for the linkage group, ideally identifying all four homologous chromosomes from each parent, and other SNPs were placed relative to these. A computer routine was written to check the most likely phase of each non-simplex SNP with respect to each simplex marker, and alleles were designated as in coupling or repulsion with each if the LOD score was greater than 5.0. Any SNP with an unknown or incomplete phase after this step had its phase assigned manually, using SNP pairs with as high a LOD as possible and also a high LOD difference between the most likely and the second most likely phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Map checking by QTL mapping of the theta scores</title><p>The linkage map can be checked by QTL interval mapping of the original theta scores on the linkage map. This gives a check of the position of the SNP, and whether the phase has been identified correctly. For example, if a SNP has been identified as a simplex SNP on chromosome d of parent 1, we expect the theta score for that SNP to map to the SNP position, and for the coefficient associated with chromosome d of parent 1 to be the only significant coefficient.</p><p>The approach used for QTL interval mapping is similar to that proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Hackett1">[14]</xref>, with modification of the estimation of the QTL genotype probabilities to take into account the dosage information.

For M2 there are 18 possible genotypes (i.e. every configuration including chromosome f). For M3, there are 15 possible genotypes that give the observed dosage. We infer that there must have been a recombination between M1 and M2, as M1 has chromosomes g and h from parent 2 and M2 has chromosome f. This is compatible with a bivalent pairing of f with g and e with h in parent 2. The genotype cdfh will give the observed dosages for SNPs M2 and M3 as well as M4. Therefore this sequence of dosages can be obtained from one recombination in parent 2, between SNPs M1 and M2, and no recombination in parent 1 over this section. All other possible reconstructions would involve more recombination events.</p><p>In general, for a chromosome with <italic>K</italic> SNPs, we obtain a 36 by <italic>K</italic> matrix for each offspring indicating whether the observed offspring dosage can be obtained from that genotype or not.</p><p>Hackett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Hackett1">[14]</xref> used a branch and bound algorithm to search for sequences of genotypes and recombination positions that give the observed sequence, with as few crossovers as possible. Usually there are several possible sequences, so we obtain the probabilities of the offspring having each possible genotype at each SNP position. However the branch and bound method had the disadvantage of not allowing for any errors in the scoring process. It is also too slow to be extended to high density maps. Therefore we have used an alternative approach to this step, based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Rabiner1">[30]</xref>.</p><p>A HMM has a series of states, forming a path. Transition probabilities model the transitions from one state to another. From each state, symbols are emitted, modelled by emission probabilities. Only the symbols are observable, and the aim is to infer the path of states from the observed symbols.</p><p>Denote the path of states as {&#x003c0;<sub>i</sub>, <italic>i</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1&#x02026;<italic>K</italic>} and the sequence of observed symbols as {<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>i</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1&#x02026;<italic>K</italic>}. The transition probability between states is given by<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0063939.e020"/></disp-formula>and is independent of the states at earlier times. The emission probability is given by<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0063939.e021"/></disp-formula>and depends on the state of the hidden variable at time <italic>i</italic>.</p><p>To apply this to a single offspring, consider the 36 genotypes to be the unobservable states at SNP positions 1 to <italic>K</italic> along the chromosome, where positions here replaced the usual HMM &#x02018;times&#x02019;.

The emission probabilities therefore become<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0063939.e023"/></disp-formula>The transition probabilities depend on the distance between SNPs, and the number of recombinations to move between two states. At this point it is necessary to take into account the process of bivalent formation. Under the model of random chromosomal segregation, the chromosomes pair at meiosis into bivalents, and then recombination occurs within each bivalent. (In the small example above the observed dosages could not occur if chromosomes c and d have paired together in parent 1, or if chromosomes g and h have paired together in parent 2.) We model this by considering each of the bivalent pairings separately, and then combining the results, weighted by the overall probability of observing the symbol sequence from that bivalent.</p><p>For example, consider bivalent pairing chromosome a with b and c with d in parent 1 and e with f and g with h in parent 2.</p><p>If the state at position <italic>i</italic> is aceg, then if there are no recombinations the process will remain in state aceg at position <italic>i</italic>+1.

The recoded simplex SNPs were found to fit well on the maps.</p><p>Duplex-simplex SNP pairs with significant non-independent segregations (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) were used to tentatively identify homologous chromosomes. For Stirling, eight groups with four homologous chromosomes, three groups with three homologous chromosomes, one group with five homologous chromosomes (two of which were very short) and one isolated group were identified. For 12601ab1, six groups with four homologous chromosomes, four with three chromosomes, two with five chromosomes (again, two were very short) and one isolated chromosome were identified, giving twelve groups and one isolated chromosome for each parent. Significant simplex to double-simplex coupling pairs identified matches between the chromosomes from each parent, giving 12 tentative linkage groups.</p><p>The simplex SNPs were also combined with simplex AFLPs and simplex SSR alleles scored on this population to compare the linkage groups with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bradshaw1">[1]</xref> (data not shown). This showed that seven tentative groups of SNPs corresponded to chromosomes I (Ia and Ib combined), II, III, IV, V, VI and VIII of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bradshaw1">[1]</xref>. The other five groups of SNPs corresponded to groupings XIa, XIb and C combined, A and F combined, B and D. N. Subramanian (unpublished PhD thesis) has constructed an AFLP and DArT map of this population and has compared this with the diploid potato map of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-The1">[34]</xref> to identify D, A/F, XIa, XIb/C, and B as chromosomes VII, IX, X, XI and XII respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Clustering the SNPs</title><p>After elimination of the distorted SNPs, 3205 SNPs were used for the first cluster analysis, with 1405 simplex and duplex SNPs from Stirling and 1800 double-simplex and higher dosage SNPs. The second cluster analysis had 2995 SNPs, 1195 simplex and duplex SNPs from 12601ab and the 1800 double-simplex and higher dosage SNPs. An inspection of different clustering thresholds suggested a choice of <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1 be made for the average significance for partitioning. At this level, there were 30 clusters from the analysis of the Stirling and higher dosage SNPs, and 32 groups from the analysis of the 12601ab1 and higher dosage SNPs. The clusters typically consisted of simplex SNPs from groups identified above as homologous together with higher dosage makers, but longer simplex coupling groups were regularly split up. These were merged manually if they consisted of simplex SNPs mapped together by the JoinMap analysis. Corresponding clusters from the two analyses were merged manually, ensuring that all higher dosage SNPs were clustered in their groups by the analyses from both parents, rather than just one. Twelve clusters of SNPs resulted, and comparison with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Felcher1">[18]</xref> confirmed the earlier identification of the clusters as chromosomes I&#x02013;XII.

rid="pone-0063939-t001">Table 1</xref>, the simplex and triplex configurations can be treated as a single class for linkage analysis. Considering all possible pairs of SNPs in all phases, there are a total of 67 pairs to be investigated. Simulations were carried out for pairs with true recombination fractions of 0.1 and 0.05. For brevity in the results below, we present the figures for the true recombination fraction of 0.1 first, followed by that for the true recombination fraction of 0.05 in brackets. The mean recombination fractions and mean LOD scores were calculated over 20 populations of 200 offspring for each value of the recombination fraction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063939-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows histograms of the mean recombination fractions and the corresponding LOD scores. Most of the mean recombination fractions are close to the simulated values of 0.1 (0.05), with one outlier in each case with mean recombination fraction of 0.38 (0.34). These were from the same configuration, consisting of a XSS SNP linked to a SS SNP, in repulsion in each parent. This configuration also had the lowest mean LOD score, of 0.58 (0.69).</p><fig id="pone-0063939-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0063939.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Distribution of statistics estimated from simulated SNP pairs.</title><p>(A) Histogram of the estimated recombination fractions, simulated with expectation 0.1.

(D) Histogram of the corresponding estimated LOD scores.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0063939.g002"/></fig><p>Traditionally a LOD of 3.0 is used to infer linkage, but most LOD scores here are much higher than this. For dominant markers, simplex+simplex (S+S) markers in coupling phase have the highest LOD scores. For this study, these had a mean LOD score of 32.1 (41.3). Four configurations had higher mean LOD scores: XSS+XSS in coupling phase (mean LOD 43.1 (62.1)), SS+SS in coupling phase (mean LOD 40.5 (57.2)), DS+DS in coupling phase (mean LOD 38.9 (59.7)) and DD+DD in coupling phase (mean LOD 37.8 (58.6)). For the SS+SS configuration in coupling phase, this LOD can be compared with the expected LOD of 22.9 (32.6) for this population if the marker was scored as a dominant marker without dosage information (using the formula in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Meyer1">[15]</xref>). Likewise the mean LOD score for a pair of duplex SNPs linked in coupling was 26.6 (37.5), compared with an expected LOD of 14.8 (21.1) if these were scored as dominant markers.</p><p>The worst configuration for dominant markers is S+S in repulsion phase, which here had mean LOD scores of 3.5 (3.8). Sixteen SNP configurations had lower mean LOD scores than this. Most of these were configurations containing simplex SNPs in repulsion phase or duplex SNPs in mixed phase, for example a DD SNP linked to a NxD SNP in mixed phase (mean LOD 0.9 (1.1)), or a DS SNP linked to a DS SNP in mixed phase in the first parent and repulsion in the second parent (mean LOD 1.6 (2.6)). Other configurations with low mean LOD scores were a DS SNP linked to a SD SNP in coupling in one parent and repulsion in the other (mean LOD 2.3 (3.1)), and a DD SNP linked to a SS SNP in coupling in one phase and repulsion in the other (mean LOD 1.6 (1.8)). If a pair of SNPs with one of these less informative configurations were tested in isolation, they would be wrongly classed as unlinked. However in a larger set of SNPs with a range of configurations, linkage can be established via a third SNP in a more informative configuration.</p><p>The configurations were also examined to see whether the correct phase was always inferred. For some SNP pairs, two phases are possible, but give the same recombination fraction and LOD score. An example is a pair of DD SNPs, linked in coupling in one parent and in mixed phase in the other, where the CxM and MxC phases cannot be distinguished unless information from additional SNPs is included. Apart from such pairs, the phase was inferred correctly for the configurations with high LOD scores. For the configuration DS linked to DS in CxR phase, with mean LOD 8.5 (11.6), the phase was inferred wrongly as MxC for one of the 20 simulated populations with recombination fraction 0.1 (but was always inferred correctly when the recombination fraction was 0.05). However the recombination fractions and LOD scores were very similar. For the configuration SD linked to SS in CxR phase, with mean LOD 5.7 (8.6), the phase was inferred wrongly as RxC for one of the 20 simulated populations with recombination fraction 0.1, and for XSS linked to DS in CxC phase, mean LOD 5.5 (9.8), two of the 20 populations with recombination fraction 0.1 were wrongly inferred as RxR. For the simulations with true recombination fraction 0.05, the configuration SS linked to SD in RxC phase, with mean LOD 2.4 (3.7), the phase was inferred incorrectly for three of the simulated sets, twice as CxC and once as CxR. These were the only incorrect inferences of phase for configurations with a mean LOD score greater than 3, but incorrect inferences became more common for configurations with mean LOD score below 3.</p><p>On the basis of this small study, we conclude that this approach identifies the correct phase and estimates recombination fractions precisely for all but the least informative configurations. Using dosage information leads to higher LOD scores than when the corresponding configuration is scored as presence/absence. For the least informative configurations, some linkages will be missed, and some phases may be inferred incorrectly, and the probability of this happening increases with increased marker separation, as for presence/absence markers. However incorrect inferences can be avoided by using information from additional markers in more informative configurations. We found no cases of an incorrect inference with a high LOD score.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Ordering the markers</title><p>After removal of the near-duplicate SNPs, recombination fractions and LOD scores were calculated between all pairs of SNPs in each chromosomal group for each possible phase, and the recombination fractions and LOD scores with the highest log-likelihood were written to a pairwise data file for analysis with JoinMap 4. The following JoinMap options were used: the Haldane mapping function; using only pairs of SNPs with recombination fractions less than 0.45 and LOD scores greater than 0.05, and to run a ripple search after every five SNPs were added to the map. Two mapping rounds were run with JoinMap, and the JoinMap diagnostics to check the fit of the mapped SNPs were examined.</p><p>It was found that XSS SNPs gave particular problems in the map assembly. As there were only a small number of these, it was decided to omit this class of SNPs from the JoinMap analysis. Isolated simplex SNPs placed into a chromosomal group by the cluster analysis but unlinked to any of the other simplex SNPs were also omitted from the JoinMap analysis. The map obtained after two rounds of JoinMap was used as the first estimate of the linkage map (the &#x02018;mapped&#x02019; SNPs). Other SNPs were placed in approximate bins according to their maximum LOD with the mapped SNPs, provided the recombination fraction was less than 0.05. These are referred to as the binned SNPs.</p><p>SNP phases were estimated for the mapped and binned SNPs as described above. The QTL mapping approach (see details below) was then used to map the theta scores for the mapped and binned SNPs as quantitative traits on the linkage map of mapped SNPs. Where discrepancies were identified, the SNPs in question were removed and the JoinMap analysis and QTL analysis were rerun. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0063939-t007">Table 7</xref> gives the final numbers of omitted SNPs, mapped SNPs and binned SNPs for each chromosome.

the inferred phase of the mapped and binned SNPs when their theta scores were mapped as quantitative traits. We will look at chromosome V in detail. This had 396 SNPs according to the cluster analysis, of which 158 were removed as near-duplicates, giving 238 for the JoinMap analysis. Eleven XSS SNPs and eight isolated simplex SNPs were also excluded before the JoinMap ordering was run. The first analysis mapped 99 SNPs, and left 120 unmapped. Six of the unmapped SNPs were too far from any of the mapped SNPs to be placed in bins, but the remaining 114 were allocated to bins. All the mapped SNPs, binned SNPs and the 19 SNPs excluded from the JoinMap run were analysed by QTL mapping of the theta scores.</p><p>For the mapped SNPs, the %variance explained ranged from 85.6% to 99.4%, with a mean of 94.0%. One SNP mapped as a QTL to a position 11 cM from its location as a marker, but the other 98 mapped SNPs had less than 5 cM between the locations as markers and as QTLs, with mean displacement 0.8 cM. For the binned markers, the %variance explained ranged from 77.0% to 99.4%, with a mean of 92.3%. There were greater displacements between the locations as markers and as QTLs, with a mean displacement of 3.9 cM and a maximum displacement of 31 cM. Two of the SNPs excluded from the JoinMap analysis had lower %variance explained, at 65% and 68% respectively. For comparison, 100 random traits generated from a standard normal distribution were analysed by the same approach to look at the distribution of the %variance: this had a mean of 4.0% and an upper 95% point of 9.4%.</p><p>All SNPs with %variance &#x0003c;85% or a discrepancy between the SNP phase and the significant QTL coefficients were inspected graphically. A further 33 SNPs (7 mapped, 26 binned) were excluded as a result of this process, due to trend or excess scatter leading to uncertainty in the SNP genotype inference. The JoinMap ordering was rerun without these SNPs, giving a final map of 119 mapped SNPs, 65 binned SNPs and two unmapped SNPs that were too far from the mapped SNPs to be placed in a bin. The QTL mapping analysis was rerun and no further problems were found. The mean displacement between positions as markers and positions as QTLs of the remaining binned markers decreased to 3.0 cM, with a maximum displacement of 14 cM. This is still higher than for the mapped markers, probably due to the lower precision of the position of the binned markers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0063939-t009">Table 9</xref> illustrates the phase information and QTL coefficients for three of the mapped markers.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0063939-t009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0063939.t009</object-id><label>Table 9</label><caption><title>QTL coefficients for three examples of SNPs mapped on LG V.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0063939-t009-9" xlink:href="pone.0063939.t009"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SNP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Map pos.

However segregation in autotetraploids is more complicated, as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Mather1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Mather2">[35]</xref>. Double reduction results in two sister chromatids occurring in a single gamete. This occurs when a multivalent is formed with a cross-over between a locus and the centromere, and the two pairs of chromatids migrate to the same pole at the first meiotic division. Double reduction may lead to some offspring having dosages that are not possible under the model of random chromosomal segregation. This is most obvious for the configurations having two categories of offspring under random chromosomal segregation, simplex and triplex SNPs. For a simplex SNP, AAAA x AAAB, double reduction can produce AABB offspring. For a triplex SNP, AAAA x ABBB, double reduction can produce AAAA offspring. The simplex and triplex SNP data was re-examined for double reduction products. To do this, the theta scores were regressed on the dosage class to estimate the difference <italic>d</italic> between the theta scores for the two dosage classes. A double reduction product is expected to be separate from these classes i.e. to have a large residual. Any SNP where there were residuals greater than 0.75*<italic>d</italic> were inspected graphically and the identities of individuals with double reduction products noted. An example is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063939-g009">Figure 9</xref>, which shows the theta scores for simplex SNP c2_45058 at 8.6 cM on LG I with a probable double reduction product for individual 160. This individual showed a similar pattern for the linked SNP c2_6865 at 0.0 cM.</p><fig id="pone-0063939-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0063939.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>An example of theta scores showing a double reduction product.</title><p>A plot of the theta scores for simplex SNP c2_45058 at 8.6 cM on LG I shows a probable double reduction product for individual 160.

It was not always clear whether extreme values were due to double reduction products or to trend. Double reduction was therefore inferred only for individuals with a double reduction product for two or more SNPs linked in coupling on the same homologous chromosome but at separate locations. For Stirling, double reduction products were detected for all but one chromosomal group. The maximum number of individuals where double reduction has occurred on a chromosomal group (i.e. on any of the 4 homologous chromosomes) was six of the population of 190, with a mean number of 2.7 individuals. For 12601ab1, double reduction products were detected for eight of the twelve chromosomal groups. The maximum number of individuals was 13, with a mean of 3.4 individuals. We conclude that the rate of double reduction in this population is low, but could be usefully explored more once issues of trend have been addressed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper we have developed statistical methodology to construct SNP linkage maps in autotetraploid species, making use of the additional information given by the SNP allele dosages, in contrast to current methods based on allele presence/absence data. This permits the use of SNP configurations that contain little or no information with presence/absence data. For example, a triplex SNP AAAA x ABBB will result in offspring that all carry both the A and B alleles (unless double reduction occurs), but dosage information will separate the AAAB offspring from the AABB, so that this SNP can be mapped. Similarly, for a simplex by duplex SNP AAAB x AABB, all offspring will carry the A allele and the ratio presence to absence of B will be 11&#x02236;1 (in the absence of double reduction), which is too high to be informative, while the dosage data identifies four classes with 0&#x02013;3 B alleles. Another advantage is that the precision of the estimates of recombination fraction may be increased by the use of dosage information compared to presence/absence information: we have demonstrated this for the case of duplex and double-simplex SNPs. The methods developed here are suitable for linkage mapping of any genotypic data derived from a technology that is informative about allele dosages for tetraploid species. We anticipate that these methods can be further extended to look at dosages derived from read counts obtained from genotyping by sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Elshire1">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The methods have been applied to construct a linkage map in the well-studied potato cross between cultivar Stirling and breeding line 12601ab1, using 190 progeny. The analysis was complicated by the discovery of some spatial trend related to sample order in the allele intensity ratios (theta scores) derived from the SNP technology employed (Illumina iSelect) as well as the Genome Studio software. This was most apparent in the non-segregating SNPs with a low range for the theta scores, but could also be found in some segregating SNPs. SNPs with a strong trend were excluded from the analysis, but some further SNPs with trends were detected and removed later, when theta values were mapped as quantitative traits. All of this analysis has been carried out using with summary-level data from Genome Studio, i.e. one observation per probe type, per sample genotype. Ritchie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Ritchie1">[37]</xref> and Dunning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Dunning1">[38]</xref> have discussed the pre-processing of this type of data and have both suggested that working with image-level or bead-level data can improve the assays by identifying and removing sources of spatial trend. There is scope for further research here. There is also scope for further analysis of the scores from Genome Studio, including the R scores as well as the theta scores, and considering whether more markers can be added to the map if null alleles are taken into account. We would recommend that the assay could be made more robust against spatial trend by an improved design, with the parents of the mapping population on every plate analysed and in the centre of the sample plate rather than at the end. For some SNP configurations, accurate parental information is essential, most notably distinguishing between the simplex by duplex and duplex by simplex configurations, and replicated parents would help this.</p><p>Methodology has also been tested for QTL mapping, using a hidden Markov model to infer QTL genotype probabilities in the offspring and modelling the traits as a function of these. So far these methods have only been applied to theta scores, where it is expected that very high proportions of the variance should be explained by a single location on the linkage map, and that the effects of the separate alleles on the traits are likely to be additive. Further testing is in progress to establish suitable thresholds for using this method for regular phenotypic traits, controlled by several QTLs and with a higher proportion of environmental variation, and to compare different models for the traits, including interactions between alleles.</p><p>The map constructed here contains 3839 mapped markers, either mapped directly or in &#x02018;bins&#x02019;. Previous maps constructed for this population contained far fewer markers (&#x0003c;500), which were primarily dominant AFLPs, with a smaller number of co-dominant SSRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bradshaw1">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bradshaw2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bryan1">[17]</xref>. Other, predominantly diploid, potato linkage maps published to date also contain a much smaller number of markers, for example the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-vanderVoort1">[39]</xref> which analysed 303 and 419 segregating AFLP markers in the two populations studied and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Bryan2">[40]</xref>, who used 384 segregating AFLP and SSR loci. A notable exception is the Ultra High Density (UHD) genetic map of potato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-vanOs1">[41]</xref> which contained more than 10,000 AFLP markers, which were placed into segregation &#x02018;bins&#x02019; due to the computational issues associated with such a large data set, and the relatively small size of the population (136 individuals). Perhaps equally as important as the increased marker number is the sequence based nature of the predominantly genic SNPs deployed here. The SNP panel was selected so as to target single copy regions of the genome, so for the majority of them it is possible to assign them a unique genomic location in the published potato genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Felcher1">[18]</xref>. This direct &#x02018;map to genome&#x02019; link has major implications for those aiming to identify candidate genes at trait loci, whereby the set of potato genes flanked by any set of SNP markers can now be identified in a facile manner. Work is in progress to compare and integrate the map reported here, along with one of a diploid cross made using the same SNP panel, to information on the potato genome sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-The1">[34]</xref>. Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063939.s001">Figure S1</xref> shows a preliminary comparison between the SNPs on chromosome I of this cross and the order of the SNPs that are in common with chromosome I of the diploid DRH cross from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063939-Felcher1">[18]</xref>, as shown in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063939-g001">Figure 1</xref>.
