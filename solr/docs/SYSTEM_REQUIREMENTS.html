<h1>System Requirements</h1>
<p>Apache Solr runs on Java 8 or greater.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to always use the latest update version of your Java VM, because bugs may affect Solr. An overview of known JVM bugs can be found on <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs">http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs</a></p>
<p>With all Java versions it is strongly recommended to not use experimental <code>-XX</code> JVM options.</p>
<p>CPU, disk and memory requirements are based on the many choices made in implementing Solr (document size, number of documents, and number of hits retrieved to name a few). The benchmarks page has some information related to performance on particular platforms. </p>
