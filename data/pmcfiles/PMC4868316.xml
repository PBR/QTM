In the past, it has been shown that the choice of tomato cultivar significantly influenced the allergic reaction of tomato allergic subjects. In this study we investigated the allergenic potential of the cultivated tomato line M82 and of two selected lines carrying small chromosome regions from the wild species <italic>Solanum pennellii</italic> (i.e. IL7-3 and IL12-4). We evaluated the positive interactions of IgEs of allergic subjects in order to investigate the different allergenic potential of the lines under investigation. We used proteomic analyses in order to identify putative tomato allergens. In addition, bioinformatic and transcriptomic approaches were applied in order to analyse the structure and the expression profiles of the identified allergen-encoding genes. These analyses demonstrated that fruits harvested from the two selected introgression lines harbour a different allergenic potential as those from the cultivated genotype M82. The different allergenicity found within the three lines was mostly due to differences in the IgE recognition of a polygalacturonase enzyme (46 kDa), one of the major tomato allergens, and of a pectin methylesterase (34 kDa); both the proteins were more immunoreactive in IL7-3 compared to IL12-4 and M82. The observed differences in the allergenic potential were mostly due to line-dependent translational control or post-translational modifications of the allergens. We demonstrated, for the first time, that the introgression from a wild species (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>pennellii</italic>) in the genomic background of a cultivated tomato line influences the allergenic properties of the fruits. Our findings could support the isolation of favorable wild loci promoting low allergenic potential in tomato.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors thank GenoPOM-pro (PON02_00395_3082360) and BenTeN (POR Campania FESR 2007/2013 O.O.2.1) for the financial support to the activities reported in the present study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) is one of the most consumed vegetables around the world (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat.fao.org">http://faostat.fao.org</ext-link>) and its raw or processed consumption increased over the last two decades also because it contains numerous nutritional and health-related compounds [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, tomato may be also involved in local (oral allergy syndrome) or systemic (urticaria/angioedema) allergic reactions [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although some studies claim that the prevalence of tomato allergy ranges from 1.5% in Northern Europe up to more than 16% in Italy [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], other studies suggest much lower figures and show that most cases of tomato allergy are due to the co-recognition of the plant panallergen profilin [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>To date, 27 potential tomato allergens, including different isoforms, have been reported and were published in different databases [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In particular, six tomato allergens were recognized by the International Union of Immunological Society (IUIS): profilin (Sola I 1), beta-fructofuranosidase (Sola I 2), non-specific lipid-transfer protein (nsLTP; Sola I 3), intracellular pathogenesis-related protein (Sola I 4), cyclophilin (Sola I 5) and nsLTP 7s (Sola I 6). In particular, Sola I 3 is an allergen still present in processed tomato products [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In previous studies it has been demonstrated that the allergenic potential of tomato fruits depends also on the cultivar under investigation [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Variable reaction patterns of patients' sera to tomato fruits from different cultivars have been described [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, when endogenous allergen concentrations have been characterised in different tomato cultivars, they have been found to vary significantly [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, up to date, the characterization of the endogenous allergen content within new hybrids or varieties produced through traditional breeding has not been considered a priority also because usually allergic individuals avoid the allergenic food regardless of the used cultivar [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>As for other crops, tomato improvement depends on the availability of genetic variability. The germplasm of cultivated tomato shows a reduced genetic variability as a consequence of its natural reproduction systems (autogamy) and of domestication and breeding history [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the contrary, wild tomato species are characterised by a rich genetic variability and can provide plant breeders with a broad pool of potentially useful gene/alleles that could be introduced into modern varieties to improve specific traits. Many tomato cultivars have been improved for quality traits as a consequence of the introgression of wild alleles responsible for increased soluble solid content, fruit colour and adaption to harvesting [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among the available tomato genetic resources, the introgression lines (ILs), which carry homozygous genomic regions of wild tomato species in the cultivated <italic>S</italic>. <italic>lycopersicum</italic> genetic background, can provide a wide array of unexplored genetic variation and represent a valuable tool for breeders [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed, the introgression lines of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pennellii</italic> into the genomic background of the cultivated <italic>S</italic>. <italic>lycopersicum</italic> genotype M82 were successfully used to map several QTLs and identify candidate genes associated to fruit quality traits [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Breeding programmes that include crop wild relatives with lower or higher allergenic potential, may result in cultivars that have a potential of safe or unsafe consumption for affected consumers. In fact, there is a vast array of gene products that are potentially brought from the wild relatives into the cultivated genetic background and that could possibly interact with those in the cultivated crop modifying proteins across allergen pathways [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. With this in mind, in this study we assessed the allergenicity of two tomato <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pennellii</italic> introgression lines in comparison with the cultivated M82 used as control. We investigated both IL7-3 and IL12-4 since previous studies demonstrated that they could be potentially used for breeding schemes because of their high antioxidant content [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In order to assess the allergenic potential of the two ILs we evaluated the positive interactions of IgEs of tomato-allergic subjects and we identified putative tomato allergens using proteomic analyses. In addition, bioinformatic and transcriptomic investigations were carried out to analyse the structure and the expression profiles of the identified allergen encoding genes. Such kind of analyses, focused on the relationship between the introgression of wild alleles and the potential allergenicity of tomato fruits, have never been done before and could help to isolate wild <italic>loci</italic> influencing tomato fruits allergenic properties [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant cultivation</title><p>Seeds from the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pennellii</italic> in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>lycopersicum</italic> introgression lines IL12-4 (accession LA4102), IL7-3 (accession LA4066) and from their parental line M82 (accession LA3475) were kindly provided by the Tomato Genetics Resource Centre (TGRC) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/">http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/</ext-link>). In the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, tomato plants were grown according to a completely randomized block design with three replicates (10 plants/replicate) in an experimental field located in Acerra (Naples, Italy). Samples of ~20 full mature red fruits <italic>per</italic> plant were collected.

Then, they were bound to nitrocellulose membrane and first stained with the Ponceau S staining solution [0.1% (w/v) Ponceau S in 5% (v/v) acetic acid] to check that same amounts of proteins were loaded in each well. Membranes were incubated overnight with pooled sera (diluted 1:10; PBS Tween 0.1%). After washing, membranes were incubated with polyclonal anti-human IgE-secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy) and the signals were detected using the SuperSignal West Dura detection kit (Pierce). X-ray film (Kodak) image analysis was applied to quantify reactivity signals. Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics) was used to quantify immunochemical signals determining the integral optical density (IOD) of the immunoreactive spots.

One &#x003bc;L of the resulting cDNA diluited 1:10 was mixed with 12.5 &#x003bc;L SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and 5 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155803.s003">S1 Table</xref>) in a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;L. The reaction was carried out using the 7900HT Fast-Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The amplification program included the following steps: 2 min at 50&#x000b0;C, 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C, 0.15 min at 95&#x000b0;C and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min for 40 cycles, followed by the thermal denaturing step (0.15 min at 95&#x000b0;C, 0.15 min at 60&#x000b0;C, 0.15 min at 95&#x000b0;C) to generate the dissociation curves in order to verify the amplification specificity. Relative RNA accumulation was calculated using the elongation factor 1- &#x003b1; (Solyc06g005060) as reference gene. All reactions were run in triplicate for each of the three biological replicates.

This phenomenon was more dramatic in the peel of the tomato fruits for all the tested lines. Immunoblot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155803.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) indicate that the different allergenicity demonstrated by the three tomato lines may be linked also to differences in the N-glycan structure of the allergenic proteins in the two introgression lines compared to M82.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Expression of allergen-encoding genes</title><p>Expression profiles of the allergen-encoding genes in the pulp and peel tissues of tomato fruits harvested from the three lines were assessed by using qRT-PCR.

This work aims to address the question of whether the introgression of genomic regions from the wild species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pennellii</italic> in the genomic background of cultivated tomato line (M82) may influence the allergenic potential of tomato fruits. It points out that when this species is used in breeding schemes to transfer favourable alleles in cultivated tomato varieties, it is also crucial to assess the risk linked to the potential allergenicity of the new-developed plant material. Indeed, we identified the PG2A (Solyc10g080210), the PME1 (Solyc07g064170) and PME2.1 (Solyc07g064180), the nsLTP (Solyc10g075090) and the profilin as the main allergens present in tomato fruits. In addition, we confirmed the different allergenic potential of the pulp and the peel, with this latter showing a higher allergenic potential.</p><p>We showed that there are genomic regions from wild tomato species, such as <italic>Solanum pennellii</italic>, that may deeply influence the allergenic potential of tomato fruits. Indeed, fruits harvested from the introgression line IL7-3 harbour a higher total allergenic potential compared to those from the cultivated genotype M82 and from IL12-4. On the contrary, lower IgE-mediated allergic reactions were observed in extracts of IL12-4 compared to IL7-3 and M82. The variability in the allergenic potential among the three tomato lines was mostly due to differences in IgE recognition patterns of a PG2A (46 kDa), one of the major tomato allergen, and of a PME1 (34 kDa) that were more immunoreactive in IL7-3 compared to IL12-4 and M82.</p><p>We demonstrated that the allergenicity of tomato fruits is not always linked to different expression levels of the allergen-encoding genes, rather it relays on the line-dependent translational control or post-translational modifications. In particular, analyses carried out in this study suggest that the allergenicity of tomato fruits may be associated to different glycan structures of the identified proteins. Now, further studies aiming at dissecting the two ILs into sub-lines that carry introgressed regions of reduced size compared to the existing ones are underway. It is very likely that these efforts will contribute to isolate, in a more accurate way, the favorable wild genes responsible for the low allergenic potential of the region 4 on chromosome 12. At the same time, the identification of the unfavorable wild genes that determine the high allergenic potential of the region 3 on chromosome 7 can be achieved.</p><p>Altogether, the identification of genetic resources with different allergenic potential represents a valuable tool both to understand the molecular basis of tomato allergic disease and for the development of novel hypoallergenic varieties. Allergic subjects could benefit from the development of such hypoallergenic tomato fruits since they could avoid eliminating completely this important crop from their diet, increasing their quality of life. However, it is worth saying that the potential hypoallergenicity of tomatoes cannot be generalised for all the allergic subjects, since it has to be assessed according to the specific allergenic protein to which every single allergic subject is sensitised [<xref rid="pone.0155803.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155803.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Protein profile of the extracts from the pulp and the peel of tomato fruits from the lines M82, IL12-4 and IL7-3 evaluated using 4&#x02013;20% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).</title><p>(A) Staining of the nitrocellulose membrane used for subsequent immunoblot analyses with Panceu S (B) Staining of loaded gels with comassie brillant blue.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155803.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155803.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Exon-intron structures and genomic coordinates of the allergen encoding genes.</title><p>Black boxes and strand lines represent exons and introns, respectively.
