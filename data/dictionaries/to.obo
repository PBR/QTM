Amounts of anthocyanin produced depend on stored sugar and sunlight. The more stored sugar in the leaf and brighter the autumn days, the more intense red. Anthocyanin production also increases as phosphates move out of the leaves; the lack of phosphates in young leaves can also lead to the production of anthocyanin.

Young lesions are pale to grayish green, later turning yellow to grey (dead) with time. In very susceptible varieties, lesions may extend to the entire leaf length into the leaf sheath. Young leaves should not be inoculated for assay. Old or leaves with symptoms of nutrient deficiency or other diseases should also be avoided for inoculation.

comment: The worms appear suddenly in masses and move like an army from field to field so that seedbeds or the direct seeded fields look as if grazed by cattles. Generally, a transplanted crop is not severely affected. Damage by armyworms is most serious during periods of stem elongation and grain formation. Larvae defoliate plants, typically by chewing angular pieces off leaves. They may also feed on the panicle near the developing kernels causing these kernels to dry before filling. This feeding causes all or parts of the panicle to  turn white. If the entire panicle is white, the damage may also be due to stem rot or feeding by rats. The  seriousness of armyworm injury depends on the maturity of the plant and the amount of tissue consumed. Significant yield reduction can occur if defoliation is greater than 25% at 2 to 3 weeks before heading. They migrate from field to field and extensive losses are often caused within a week. Their migration is facilitated by the absence of standing water in the field.

Chlorophyll differs from heme in a few major respects, most notably that the central metal ion in chlorophyll is magnesium while that in heme is iron.

[GR:pj, GrainGenes_trait:Acid_Detergent_Fiber, web:http\://www.foragetesting.org/lab_procedure/sectionB/4/part4.1.htm]
comment: The method typically uses acidified quaternary detergent solution to dissolve cell solubles, hemicellulose and soluble minerals leaving a residue of cellulose, lignin, and heat damaged protein and a portion of cell wall protein and minerals (ash). Acid detergent fiber is determined gravimetrically as the residue remaining after extraction. The lower the acid detergent fiber, the more digestible the feed is and the higher the energy value of the feed.

def: "Malformed inflorescence (panicle in rice), by staying upright/straight at the time of maturity and may carry infertile seeds." [GR:pj, web:http\://plantpathology.tamu.edu/Texlab/Grains/Rice/rices.html]
comment: For rice: Straighthead is a physiological disorder that causes the entire head to be blank and remain upright at maturity in rice. Straighthead generally occurs in spots scattered throughout a field and is most easily recognized near harvest when normal plants have downturned heads (from the weight of the grain in the panicle). The disease is frequently found on sandy loam soils but seldom on clay soils. Old cotton fields with arsenic residues can have a severe incidence of straighthead. Other, as yet unknown, soil factors are also involved in causing straighthead. Often it is found in fields where excessive non-decayed vegetation has been plowed under just before planting. The disease is characterized by upright heads when the rice matures due to infertile seed. Hulls may be distorted into a crescent shape or "parrot beak". One or both hulls may be missing. Affected plants continue to grow, are a darker green, and often produce shoots from a lower portion of the plant. First year crops of rice grown on "new ground" are more likely to be affected. Some varieties are more tolerant than others. Control measures include planting resistant varieties and draining fields with a history of the disorder just prior to internode elongation.

comment: Symptoms: Initial infection sites tend to be irregular in shape, oval to elongated chlorotic spots or lesions. As these sites expand, the centers of the lesions become pale, straw colored, and slightly necrotic, often with numerous small black dots (pycnidia). The lesions of septoria tritici blotch tend to be linear and restricted laterally, while those of septoria nodorum blotch and septoria avenae blotch are more lens shaped. All above ground plant parts can be affected.

def: "A trait to measure the ethanol yield from the industrial processing of feedstock (biomass)." [GR:pj, TO:contributors]
comment: Often measured as volume/mass unit used by DOE-USA. It's also consistent with the common measure of fuel ethanol (volume, not mass) and common measure of biomass.  Please note that ethanol yield in liters per megagram would depend on both the ethanol conversion process and the composition (not just the quantity) of the biomass. And in most cases (at least for breeding), it probably would be predicted ethanol yield instead of ethanol yield that is directly measured from a pretreatment and fermentation process.
