Standard MDCT workflow included true non-enhanced (TNE), arterial phase, and portal venous phase. The clinical practice for detection and staging of gastric masses using CT required a baseline TNE scan immediately followed by a contrast enhanced acquisition, as it depended on the diffuse enhancement and thickening of the lesion <xref rid="pone.0112295-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However these three standard phases of scan normally derive a large amount of radiation dose which could be harmful to patients either in preoperative staging or in follow up.</p><p>Dual-energy Computed Tomography (DECT) is a promising imaging technique that provides better tissue characterization compared with single-energy computed tomography <xref rid="pone.0112295-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112295-Coursey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Based on two synchronous CT acquisitions at the same time, this technology allows the differentiation and identification of materials with different X-ray absorptions on low and high tube voltage <xref rid="pone.0112295-Graser1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This technique can differentiate attenuation of materials with large atomic numbers such as iodine-based contrast agents. On the basis of reconstruction of high- and low-kV data sets from the raw data, iodine could be extracted from a contrast-enhanced, dual-energy CT scan and virtual non-enhanced (VNE) data sets can be generated utilizing the three-material decomposition DE post-processing algorithm, which was based on the assumption of target tissue consisting of three different base materials. In the abdomen CT scan, assumption was made that contrast enhanced abdominal tissue had three base materials: soft tissue, fat, and iodine <xref rid="pone.0112295-Graser1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The generation of VNE and iodine map distribution not only emphasized the local blood supply for lesion identification, but also allowed to avoid a TNE, which could save dose for the patient, who might benefit during both preoperative staging and oncological follow-up.</p><p>Previous studies have proposed that VNE may potentially replace TNE scans; however, most of the studies used the first generation of dual-energy scanners <xref rid="pone.0112295-Graser2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112295-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These first generation dual-source scanners have the limitation of a narrow field of view. Furthermore, due to an energy spectra overlap between 100 and 140 kV, these scanners had to be operated at 80 and 140 kV, resulting in the inability to be used in the abdomen due to a low penetration depth and beam hardening artifacts <xref rid="pone.0112295-Flohr1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The recently introduced second generation dual-source scanners had overcome above problems implementing a bigger field of view (33 cm), which allowed more patients to take dual energy CT scan, and a tin filter, which reduces the X-ray spectra overlap <xref rid="pone.0112295-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112295-Karlo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, there were still few studies having used the second generation dual-source CT scanners that had assessed VNE has been published <xref rid="pone.0112295-Toepker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112295-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and to the best of our knowledge, currently no previous study has been made to compare the quality of VNE and TNE images on stomach cancer.</p><p>The aim of this work was to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the image quality and noise of TNE and VNE data sets in the same patients who underwent DECT gastric preoperative examination and to evaluate potential radiation dose reduction by omitting a TNE CT scan during dual energy CT technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>The study was approved by our Hospital Ethics Committee (Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, involved in human research ethics committee), No 2009&#x02013;34. Informed consent was obtained from each patient before imaging. Participants provided their written informed consent in this study. From April to September 2011, 74 patients (55 men, mean age of 63 years &#x000b1;11 [standard deviation], range of 37&#x02013;85 years; 19 women, mean age of 61 years &#x000b1;11, range of 27&#x02013;85 years) underwent DECT for preoperative staging of gastric cancer.

Each patient who had overnight fasted drank 1000&#x02013;1500 ml of tap water shortly before CT to enable gastric distention. All patients underwent total 3 phase of CT scan. First, a non-enhanced scan covering the whole stomach was performed with the following setting: 120 kV, reference 200 mAs, 128&#x000d7;0.6 mm collimation and a pitch of 0.6. Subsequently, one hundred milliliters of a nonionic iodinated contrast agent (370 Ultravist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) was administered via the antecubital vein at 3 mL/sec using 20-gauge needle through an automatic injector. Dual energy contrast-enhanced scans were performed at arterial phase (included the whole stomach) and portal venous phase (included the whole abdomen and pelvis, from the diaphragmatic domes to the anal verge) using dual energy mode, which were acquired at 40 s and 70 s after the administration of contrast agents, respectively. The DE scans were acquired with the tube voltages at 100 and 140 kVp with tin filter, using reference mAs values of 230 and 178, respectively. The collimation was 32&#x000d7;0.6 mm and the pitch was 0.6. All acquisitions were obtained with real time tube current modulation (Care DOSE 4D, Siemens Medical Solutions) software.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>CT Image Post-processing</title><p>The DE raw data were reconstructed using a soft convolution kernel (D30f), and three different series of images were generated: 100 kV images, Sn140 kV images, and mixed images with ratio of 0.5 with a slice thickness and an interval of 1.5 mm. Images were then transferred to a DE post-processing workstation (syngo MMWP, version 2008A; Siemens Medical Solutions).

Three measurements were recorded on the same anatomic site (except aorta) at the same slice to get an average value. At all anatomical sites, a constant size of the ROI of approximately 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> was maintained except gastric wall. The ROI including full-thickness of the gastric wall was put at the antrum to get the CT value. If the lesion was located in the antrum of the stomach, the cardia was used. In patients in whom enhanced DECT detected gastric tumors or enlarged lymph nodes were visible in the non-enhanced images, their CT attenuation values and maximal thickness or diameter were measured. Standard deviations of the retroperitoneal fat were also measured to determine the image noise using a region of interest with 1 cm<sup>2</sup> in area.</p><p>Two experienced abdominal radiologists, who were blinded to TNE, VNE<sub>A</sub> and VNE<sub>P</sub> acquisition, accessed the image quality of three sets of non-enhanced images in consensus.

VNE images with scores of 3 or above were regarded as acceptable for diagnosis purpose; ones with scores of 4 or more were regarded as having the potential to replace TNE images. Second, coverage of relevant anatomy by the generated VNE images was noted as a percentage range of excluded anatomy (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; no excluded anatomy, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1&#x02013;25% excluded, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26&#x02013;50%, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;51&#x02013;75%, 5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0003e;75%), in order to evaluate the influence of BMI on VNE images.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Radiation Dose Estimation</title><p>For each of the three phases, the dose-length product (DLP, mGy cm) were recorded.

First, the gastric tumor and enlarged lymph nodes require a baseline non-enhanced CT value to calculate the contrast enhancement, which is especially crucial in estimating whether regional lymph nodes represent local metastases or not. Second, enhancing liver metastases may be missed in enhanced images <xref rid="pone.0112295-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Third, the calcification and hemorrhage of tumor may also be missed in enhanced images <xref rid="pone.0112295-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Dual-energy CT of the abdomen provides two advantages as opposed to single-energy CT: improved image quality of the contrast enhancement itself <xref rid="pone.0112295-DeCecco1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the ability to generate VNE images. Compared with TNE images with lower image noise, VNE images are with lower but diagnostic image quality. This is due to particular image filtering and smoothing induced by the post-processing algorithm <xref rid="pone.0112295-Graser2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, radiologists can reliably discriminate both types of images. As our results revealed the similar attenuations and morphological feature between VNE and TNE images on detection of gastric cancer, VNE is likely to be regarded as a replacement for TNE scans. When compared with a triple-phase protocol, a dual-phase approach that includes arterial and portal venous phases reduces the effective dose by an average of 21.4%. This is lower than previously published data about the liver and renal images, where a dose reduction of between 30% and 35% has been described <xref rid="pone.0112295-Graser2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-DeCecco1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, as the portal venous phase scan included the whole abdomen and pelvis, from the diaphragmatic domes to the anal verge in our study. DE imaging in patients with gastric tumors is the potential to reduce the effective radiation dose delivered to the patient and also to save investigation time.</p><p>Our results suggest that VNE<sub>P</sub> images had higher subjective score than VNEA images. It should be noted that previous authors have shown VNE<sub>A</sub> images to be superior by the 1st generation DSCT <xref rid="pone.0112295-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and VNE<sub>P</sub> to be better by 2nd generation DSCT <xref rid="pone.0112295-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The reason may be due to the fact that the arterially derived series required an additional post-processing step; they were acquired as 1 mm thick slices and needed to be &#x02018;thickened&#x02019; to create virtual 2 mm slices <xref rid="pone.0112295-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Certainly the use of additional post-processing steps has the potential to degrade the images. There is little to choose between the portal and arterial derived series, however, we recommend the use of the VNE<sub>P</sub> images over the VNE<sub>A</sub> images because of the slightly better objective and subjective results and the reduced post-processing time.</p><p>As the larger FOV of the smaller detector, which is 33 cm in the second generation DSCT, our study suggested relevant anatomy was considered to be excluded in only one case; in this case that was considered minimal and was &#x0003c;25%. Moreover, a further advantage of gastric DECT is that as a result of the median position of the stomach and the locations of lymphatic metastasis in the abdomen, the smaller FOV hardly affected the gastric preoperative CT scan.</p><p>However, with the present technology DECT has several limitations. First, as previous authors have shown, calcium is not among the three materials (soft tissue, iodine, and fat) analyzed in the decomposition process. This limitation can potentially be problematic especially for the detection of mucinous gastric carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0112295-Libson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, but it can be overcome by using another post-processing algorithm that analyses calcium, iodine, and soft tissue <xref rid="pone.0112295-Graser2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Second, dedicated filtering algorithms can be used to reduce image noise, but again, it may be more difficult to resolve small structures <xref rid="pone.0112295-Yeh1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Third, to further reduce radiation dose from CT scanning, the lesion can be located on TNE images to define the minimum possible scanning range in arterial phase; in addition, the patient can drink more water or change the position after TNE scan, if not good enough distention gastric wall and lesion were found in TNE images. Omitting TNE scan will make these impossible. Finally, overshooting artifact detected at the gas-fluid level was more obvious in VNE images. Though this kind of artifact has not impaired the image quality, but it could represent an important pitfall in some cases. Since this was not among the aims of our study, further analysis is required.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. It was performed to prove the quality of VNE images, and not to show the capabilities of DECT in the accuracy of preoperative staging of gastric cancer. Therefore, the diagnostic value of different types of visualization of the DE information, including color coding of iodine distribution, was not assessed in this study. Further research should be recommended to show whether DECT will help depict and accurately preoperative staging in gastric cancer. Second, we did not evaluate the performance of VNE images in detecting liver lesions which is an important route of metastatic gastric cancer. However, in previous reports, VNE images show a quality comparable with that of TNE images, and potential to replace TNE as part of a multiphase liver imaging protocol <xref rid="pone.0112295-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-DeCecco1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112295-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Third, since no calcification in stomach tumors was found in our data, the limitation of subtraction of calcium by the Liver VNC algorithm could not be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our early experience with gastric virtual non-enhanced images using second generation dual-source CT demonstrates promising results. Virtual non-enhanced images generated from either arterial or portal venous phase images provide attenuation values and morphological parameter close to the true non-enhanced images, and demonstrate good image quality. It will be potentially possible to omit TNE scan as part of a multiphase gastric preoperative staging and follow-up study imaging protocol, resulting in significantly reducing the radiation dose.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0112295-Yan1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>ZG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>ZL</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Value of Multidetector-Row Computed Tomography in the Preoperative T and N Staging of Gastric Carcinoma: A Large-Scale Chinese Study</article-title>. <source>J Surg Oncol</source><volume>100(3)</volume>: <fpage>205</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>214</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19530124</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0112295-Chen1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>CY</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>WY</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hsieh</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2007</year>) <article-title>Gastric cancer: preoperative local staging with 3D multi-detector row CT&#x02013;correlation with surgical and histopathologic results</article-title>. <source>Radiology</source><volume>242(2)</volume>: <fpage>472</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>482</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17255419</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0112295-Fletcher1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fletcher</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hartman</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Guimaraes</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Huprich</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Dual-energy and dual-source CT: is there a role in the abdomen and pelvis?</article-title><source>Radiol Clin North Am</source><volume>47(1)</volume>: <fpage>41</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>57</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19195533</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0112295-Graser1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Graser</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chandarana</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Macari</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Dual energy CT: preliminary observations and potential clinical applications in the abdomen.
