We used the microtuber system, in which tubers were produced <italic>in vitro</italic> and stored at 20&#x000b0;C, to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for dormancy and gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) content in an <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> population consisting of 178 genotypes derived from an interspecific cross between <italic>Solanum chacoense</italic> acc. PI 320285 (long dormancy) and <italic>Solanum phureja</italic> acc. DM1-3 516 R44 (short dormancy). In this analysis, 163 markers were used to construct a genetic map with a total length of 591.8 cM. Through QTL analysis, we identified 22 markers closely linked to the timing of dormancy release and GA<sub>3</sub> content. The male parent alleles were closely related with long dormancy, with the most significant effect on chromosome I, which accounted for 9.4% of phenotypic variation. The dormancy and GA<sub>3</sub> QTLs localized to the same position in the genome, confirming that same genomic region controls GA<sub>3</sub> content at different developmental stages or in dormant and sprouting tubers. The identified QTLs may be useful for future breeding strategies and studies of dormancy in potato.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="precis"><p><bold>Summary:</bold> Quantitative trait locus&#x02019; (QTLs) for dormancy and gibberellic acid production in potato are localized to the same genomic region in potato.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Potato</kwd><kwd>Microtuber</kwd><kwd>QTL</kwd><kwd>Dormancy</kwd><kwd>Gibberellic acid</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004573</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201303007</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003819</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CFA104</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest, Hubei</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013BBB07</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Worldwide, the potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.) is a staple food source for more than a billion people (<xref rid="BIO027375C24" ref-type="bibr">Mullins et al., 2006</xref>); and in 2014, 385 million tonnes of potatoes were produced globally (<xref rid="BIO027375C10" ref-type="bibr">FAOSTAT, 2016</xref>). After harvest, the potatoes are put into storage to ensure a continuous supply; however, long-term potato storage can produce sprouts after tuber dormancy is released, which reduces tuber quality for both fresh consumption and processing.</p><p>Dormancy is a physiological condition in plants characterised by the arrest of growth (<xref rid="BIO027375C4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2008</xref>). Potato tubers are not dehydrated like cereal seeds, they are metabolically active and require an endodormancy period to initiate sprout growth. Controlling the dormancy period is, therefore, of substantial economic importance. Commercially, chemical sprouting inhibitors have been used for many years to control tuber sprouting during storage (<xref rid="BIO027375C37" ref-type="bibr">Van den Berg et al., 1996</xref>), but consumers prefer potatoes that do not have any chemical residues. Cold storage is commonly adopted in the processing industry to prolong tuber storage, but cold-induced sweetening can be a problem for processing (<xref rid="BIO027375C34" ref-type="bibr">Tareke et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Breeding long-dormancy varieties is agriculturally desirable to ensure the long-term storage of good quality potatoes (<xref rid="BIO027375C45" ref-type="bibr">Tarn et al., 1992</xref>); however, long dormancy varieties cannot be produced in regions where a short dormancy period is needed to harvest potato crops twice a year. In fact, varieties with different dormancy lengths are preferable to meet the diverse agricultural demands that change with the production region and storage length. Large numbers of genes control the complex traits of dormancy, which are affected by both environmental and developmental factors (<xref rid="BIO027375C19" ref-type="bibr">Koornneef et al., 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, little progress has been made in potato breeding that focuses on dormancy control because the inheritance of this complex trait remains mostly unknown.</p><p>The general concept for tuber dormancy starts with tuber initiation and ends with the growth of a visible sprout. Tuber dormancy is a complicated process that depends on genetic background, tuber developmental stage, environmental and management conditions during tuber growth, and storage (<xref rid="BIO027375C41" ref-type="bibr">Vreugdenhil, 2004</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that at least nine different loci are involved in controlling tuber dormancy (<xref rid="BIO027375C37" ref-type="bibr">Van den Berg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C9" ref-type="bibr">Ewing et al., 2004</xref>). Some quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for tuber dormancy have been identified in three molecular mapping studies that demonstrated the complex nature of the dormancy trait (<xref rid="BIO027375C13" ref-type="bibr">Freyre et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C37" ref-type="bibr">Van den Berg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C29" ref-type="bibr">&#x0015a;liwka et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Potato tuber dormancy is controlled by plant hormones (<xref rid="BIO027375C31" ref-type="bibr">Suttle, 2004a</xref>). The exogenous use of gibberellic acid (GA) tends to break the dormancy of the tuber (<xref rid="BIO027375C1" ref-type="bibr">Aksenova et al., 2013</xref>), although there are no obvious or incremental levels of GA that are required before the visible germination of the tubers. Furthermore, when GA was used with the plant foliage, the tubers broke dormancy at a faster rate compared to tubers from the untreated plants (<xref rid="BIO027375C2" ref-type="bibr">Alexopoulos et al., 2008</xref>). Gibberellins can break dormancy and support bud growth; they require cytokinins to promote shoot growth and elongation. Active sprout growth is stimulated by GA after tuber dormancy is released, and endogenous GA-like compound activity is lower during dormancy as well as prior to bud outgrowth (<xref rid="BIO027375C17" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, injecting GA beneath the apical bud complex or dipping isolated tuber buds in GA solutions confirmed its ability to release tubers from dormancy (<xref rid="BIO027375C31" ref-type="bibr">Suttle, 2004a</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C17" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C27" ref-type="bibr">Rentzsch et al., 2012</xref>). Studies have revealed that treating potatoes with bioactive GA species can break dormancy and stimulate bud growth. In these experiments, the activity of endogenous GA-like compounds was found to be low during dormancy and increase before bud growth. During tuber storage, dormancy can be broken by treatment with GA (<xref rid="BIO027375C7" ref-type="bibr">Claassens and Vreugdenhil, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The application of exogenous GA<sub>1</sub> or GA<sub>3</sub> can lead to tuber bud dormancy release as well as the beginning bud sprouting. The rate of endogenous bioactive GA<sub>1</sub> is not related to bud dormancy release, but it is related to subsequent bud sprouting (<xref rid="BIO027375C32" ref-type="bibr">Suttle, 2004b</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C17" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>).

<italic>thaliana</italic> or potato had a diminished dormancy length and extended sprout development, indicating the function of GA in dormancy release (<xref rid="BIO027375C17" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>). Correlative evidence confirmed that dormancy and GA have a causal relationship, although there is also a possible relationship between gibberellins and potato tuber dormancy (<xref rid="BIO027375C27" ref-type="bibr">Rentzsch et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that a better understanding of the underlying genetic mechanism is essential to provide insight into how dormancy is controlled in potatoes.</p><p>Biotechnology tools are broadly utilized for the improvement and expansion of traditional potato cultivation for their production as a food crop. Moreover, marker-assisted selection (MAS) is also currently being utilized in potato breeding as it is to a great extent restricted to one gene, and wide-effect QTL analysis (<xref rid="BIO027375C24" ref-type="bibr">Mullins et al., 2006</xref>). QTL analysis is a valuable tool for understanding complex traits such as dormancy. To date, no study has reported the changes in GA content or its role in dormancy release. We used a QTL analysis of a segregating population in a microtuber system to identify the genetic loci that could control potato tuber dormancy and GA<sub>3</sub> biosynthesis. This study will provide a potential approach for the selection and improvement of the dormancy trait in potato breeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phenotypic variation</title><p>Significant variations were observed among the genotypes in the segregating population grown <italic>in vitro</italic> for dormancy period and GA<sub>3</sub> content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027375F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).

The data on dormancy and GA<sub>3</sub> (AS) content for <italic>S. phureja</italic> DM1-3 are missing because the tubers turned to a jelly end and dried a few days after harvest, and therefore did not sprout.

In the present study, QTL analysis was conducted with a segregating diploid population that originated from a cross between the homozygous DM1-3 516 R44 and heterozygous <italic>Solanum chacoense</italic> parents. Segregation of 42 distorted markers from 163 linked markers in our population was approximately 26%, consistent with the 25-40% of mapped loci with aberrant segregation ratios that have been reported in potato mapping populations (<xref rid="BIO027375C12" ref-type="bibr">Felcher et al., 2012</xref>). In our population, chromosomes I, II, III, VI, and XII had segregation distortion. This may be due to the presence of lethal genes or fragment complexes (i.e. overlying fragments containing identically sized fragments). The distortion could also be associated with the different sizes of the parent genomes or distorting influences such as self-incompatibility alleles (<xref rid="BIO027375C3" ref-type="bibr">Bert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C16" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 1999</xref>). Segregation distortion is common in diploid potato interspecific hybrids (<xref rid="BIO027375C28" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). In potato, crosses deviating from Mendelian segregation occur frequently. Segregation distortion markers cannot be omitted from the mapping procedure and most could be mapped to their applicable linkage groups. The segregation distortion frequency was extremely flexible among the different chromosomes, with the most significant distorted regions found on chromosomes I and IV. Previous mapping studies have also indicated changing levels of segregation distortion (<xref rid="BIO027375C28" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Potato tuber dormancy is an important agronomic trait that ensures a good harvest by being able to grow crops in the most suitable season, and is largely associated with seed tubers that are not dormant at planting. Dormancy is also a critical economic trait because its length influences the quality and loss of tubers during storage. However, it is difficult to breed a tuber variety with desirable dormancy length because little is known about the genetic basis of this trait, although its inheritance has been considered quantitative. The genetic complexity of dormancy is reflected by previous mapping efforts in various segregation populations. The very first report about tuber dormancy QTL analysis was in a diploid potato that was a hybrid of <italic>S. tuberosum</italic>&#x000d7;<italic>S. chacoense</italic> with <italic>S. phureja</italic>, and suggested that <italic>S. phureja</italic> contributed short dormancy dominant genes and six QTLs were identified on chromosomes II, III, IV, V, VII, and VIII (<xref rid="BIO027375C13" ref-type="bibr">Freyre et al., 1994</xref>). Other reports revealed nine QTLs from the <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> and <italic>S. berthaultii</italic>, which were located on chromosomes I, II, III, IV, V, VIII, IX, X, and XI with the strongest QTL on chromosome II, which represented the wild-type parent alleles that promoted long dormancy (<xref rid="BIO027375C37" ref-type="bibr">Van den Berg et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The most outstanding QTL specific for dormancy was identified on chromosome II in the diploid mapping population 98-21 produced from a cross between the hybrid clone DG 83-1529 and DG 84-195 in the potato, which explained 7.1% of the phenotypic variance (<xref rid="BIO027375C29" ref-type="bibr">&#x0015a;liwka et al., 2008</xref>). In our present research, a QTL for long dormancy was derived from <italic>S. chacoense</italic> (40-3) and mapped onto chromosome I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027375F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). The difference in its location may be due to different genetic resources used.</p><p>Potato tuber dormancy is determined by the biosynthesis of gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>). As described previously, GA<sub>3</sub> is efficient at releasing tuber dormancy (<xref rid="BIO027375C23" ref-type="bibr">Mosley et al., 2007</xref>). Previous reports revealed that dormancy termination and bud growth stimulation is promoted by the application of bioactive GA species (<xref rid="BIO027375C32" ref-type="bibr">Suttle, 2004b</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C17" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027375C27" ref-type="bibr">Rentzsch et al., 2012</xref>). As a dormancy-breaking hormone, GA<sub>3</sub> requires the presence of cytokinins to promote shoot outgrowth and elongation; these effects may be negatively regulated by strigolactones (<xref rid="BIO027375C30" ref-type="bibr">Sonnewald and Sonnewald, 2014</xref>). GA promotes germination by releasing dormancy and neutralising abscisic acid (ABA) effects that induce dormancy (<xref rid="BIO027375C5" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhuri et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, GA is a dominant regulator in tuber formation and ABA promotes tuberisation by counteracting GA activity (<xref rid="BIO027375C43" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). However, these physiological studies need more substantial evidence that shows that these hormones are genetically involved in the underlying mechanism of tuber dormancy. Our results demonstrate a significant correlation between potato the length of tuber dormancy and GA<sub>3</sub> content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027375F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). We also mapped the QTLs that confer GA<sub>3</sub> content and dormancy to the same location on chromosome I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027375F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), suggesting a higher concentration of GA<sub>3</sub> content after sprouting may support dormancy release in tubers. Additional studies are required to determine whether the traits are causally related or simply associated with one another. For example, if trait X has a causal relationship with trait Y, then the two traits should have at least one QTL in common (<xref rid="BIO027375C21" ref-type="bibr">Lebreton et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that potato tuber dormancy is controlled by GA<sub>3</sub> biosynthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide genetic evidence for the potential relationship between the physiological processes of dormancy and GA<sub>3</sub> in potato.</p><p>To find the specific genes, we identified a QTL in the region from marker G_13 to S194. By using the NCBI database, we found that the length of the region is approximately 1,452,694&#x02005;bp (1.45 Mb) and contains 217 genes (in this region by using softberry software based on DM1-3 sequence). Out of these, 131 genes assumed to control different traits, unfortunately no gene is related to our trait (GA biosynthesis/dormancy). The function of 86 remaining genes are still unknown, which may contribute to tuber dormancy or GA biosynthesis. The GA<sub>3</sub> content after harvesting is considered causal for tuber dormancy; however, the GA<sub>3</sub> content after sprouting should be associated with sprout growth. The QTL for GA<sub>3</sub> after sprouting was mapped to the same position of GA<sub>3</sub> before sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027375F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), indicating that the same genomic region on chromosome I controls the GA<sub>3</sub> content at different developmental stages or in dormant and sprouting tubers. The markers significantly associated with either dormancy or GA<sub>3</sub> before and after sprouting may have the potential for selection in potato breeding programs. There are a number of chromosomes/linkage groups with very few markers, and this could mean that there are more QTLs that are still undetected that could explain 9.4% of the variation. A full picture of dormancy in tubers cannot be obtained without integrating the knowledge of underlying genetics and physiological mechanisms. QTL high-resolution mapping for gene-based cloning needs to be further studied.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions and perspective</title><p>Assuming significant phenotypic correlation between dormancy and GA<sub>3</sub> content and the common digenic correlation of the same loci, our results propose that potato tuber dormancy and sprouting are related to GA<sub>3</sub> synthesis. This QTL might be a good candidate for the molecular breeding program for MAS targeted genes to control sprouting in the potato processing industry. The QTL identified in our diploid population is not directly applicable to tetraploid breeding strategies; however, these results are valuable for clarifying the underlying genetic basis of the dormancy trait. This information is especially useful when target gene introgression involves the same diploids. Overall, the detailed QTL analysis for detecting new markers will increase genomic resources for potato breeding that aims to improve potato quality. On the main goals of the evaluation of GA<sub>3</sub> and dormancy characteristics and traits were chosen from our population DC3, which is the pre-breeding relative to the parental lines for the development of new potato cultivars. It is suggested that expression QTL (eQTL) and QTL high-resolution mapping analyses are required to understand dormancy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant material</title><p>The diploid potato (2n=2x=24) <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> population used in this study consisted of 178 individuals produced from a cross of the cultivated species <italic>Solanum phureja</italic> acc.
